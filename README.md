# ros2_bebop_driver

This is a ROS2 rewrite derived from the original [ROS1 bebop_autonomy package](https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy).

If you wish, you could be using [ros1 bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) to use the original bebop_autonomy ROS1 package. 

This is clearly alpha release with some basic functionnalities which will hopefully grow from time to time.
